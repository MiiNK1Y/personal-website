# fucking damnit there's always some bs
- [ ] Safari does not like to figure out the tabindex itself, tabbing only work on language and some link. So try to implement a custom tabindex to each (should be) -tabbable item on the site.

- [ ] apparently the "*" to set site-wide font is inefficient, fix that.

- [ ] set the Safari-specific font only on the items that need them, the other should have the default font. (buttons need the the Safari-specific, but email can keep the default font).

- [ ] language button does not work for first-time visitors for some reason. fix that.
