# We need some fucking order in here

- [x] contact-page is bad. fix that.
- [x] make a proton mail account for website to receive mails.
- [x] add rock-paper-scissors game to projects-website.
- [x] 'button' tag should not be nested inside a 'a' tag. Fix that by styling the 'a' tag, and not use 'button'.
- [o] see the 'a'-tag sizing on the project-icons, can they cover the whole image-size?
      Cannot be fixed, images are not identifiable in the tabindex.
- [x] make 'GET Academy' project website available. Keep web-projects in their own folder, what to do? 
- [o] for navbar, make a button-container pr button to fix the overlapping-when-wrapping issue?
- [x] fix language switch.
- [x] navbar links looks funky on iphone, how to fix?
    !Fixed by specifying the font to be used on target devices.
  - [o] maybe replace the navbar hyperlinks with buttons instead on mobile devices that does not support the tabbing-function?
- [x] make project icons not available to the 'tabbing' seeker when not hovering (currently they are 'opacity: 0' which makes them seek-able)
- [o] mount the sources-window with the same container as the footer??
- [x] fix so when clicking off the source-window, the window closes.
      added a close-button instead.
- [x] fix spelling in CV (krakter bestott meget godt).
